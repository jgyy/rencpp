For twenty-three years, you've lived an ordinary life in a small village at the base of the Thousand Peak Mountains. Your days were filled with mundane tasks—farming, sweeping, carrying water—until the night everything changed.\n\nThe skies split open with celestial light. A fierce battle between cultivators raged across the heavens above your village. Swords of pure Qi carved through clouds. Mysterious incantations shook the earth. Then, as quickly as it began, the battle ceased. One cultivator fell from the sky, crashing through your roof with tremendous force.\n\nYou rush to find a magnificent young woman in white robes, bleeding and barely breathing. Her eyes flutter open, meeting yours with an urgency you've never seen before. She grips your wrist with surprising strength despite her wounds.\n\n\"Listen carefully, mortal,\" she gasps. \"The Demonic Path searches for me. In my robes, you'll find a cultivation manual. If you can master even its basics, you might survive what's coming. Whether you use it is your choice.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, she closes her eyes. Her body becomes cold. She is gone.\n\nIn trembling hands, you find a leather-bound manual glowing with faint blue light. The words inscribe themselves in your mind as you touch it: The Stellar Ascension Method. A path to cultivation. A path to immortality.\n\nThe question is: will you take it?",

Following the manual's guidance, you breathe in slowly, drawing the essence of heaven and earth into your body. The sensation is unlike anything you've experienced—warm, electric, alive.\n\nHours pass. Your body aches, but you persist. Then, just before dawn breaks, you feel it: a spark of Qi igniting in your lower Dantian, the energy center beneath your navel. It's small, barely a flicker, but it's real. You are no longer merely mortal.\n\nAs the sun rises, exhaustion overwhelms you. You collapse into sleep, your body thrumming with newfound power. In your dreams, you see visions of infinite realms, celestial palaces, and the vast Dao waiting to be understood.\n\nWhen you wake, you realize the demonic cultivators will likely search for the woman's body.

Your strength grows, and you begin to sense the Qi that flows through all living things—the trees, the animals, even the other villagers.\n\nOne evening, a merchant's caravan arrives at your village with dire news: demons have been spotted near the Thousand Peak Mountains. Several villages have been attacked. The cultivators of the Celestial Sword Sect are nowhere to be found. Fear grips your village.\n\nThat night, as you practice in your usual clearing, you sense something wrong. The forest becomes unnaturally quiet.

You realize with horror that you've made a terrible mistake—you're outmatched beyond measure.\n\nBut just as the demon prepares to strike you down, a brilliant sword of pure light pierces through his chest. He explodes into ash. The other two demons barely have time to react before they're consumed by celestial flames.\n\nA figure emerges from the shadows: an elderly man with silver hair and eyes like starlight. His robes bear the insignia of the Celestial Sword Sect.\n\n\"So, you've inherited her manual,\" he says, regarding you with curious eyes. \"I am Elder Xuan of the Celestial Sword Sect.

Form the Stellar Union Formation! Together, we are immortal!\"\n\nThe effect is instantaneous. The scattered, demoralized disciples immediately rally around you, their Qi linking together in a formation you once studied in the sect's secret archives. A thousand individual Qi streams merge into a single, unified force of absolutely devastating power.\n\nThe Demonic Sect Lord, distracted by the sudden unity of his enemies, cannot defend against the combined assault. The formation's power slams into him with the force of a meteor strike. Even his immortal body cannot withstand such an assault.\n\nHe roars in fury and attempts to flee, but you've anticipated this. The formation follows, relentless. In desperation, the demonic forces begin their retreat. Without their Sect Lord's protection, they crumble.\n\nWithin hours, the battle is over. The demonic forces are scattered. Elder Xuan survives, though gravely wounded. The Celestial Sword Sect stands victorious.\n\nIn the aftermath, as you meditate in the victory pavilion, you feel something stirring within your cultivation base. Your Qi trembles, resonates with power. You're on the verge of a breakthrough—not just to the next stage of cultivation, but to something far greater.\n\nThe path to immortality lies before you.",

Rather than deny the accusations, he laughs. He reveals himself to be a high-ranking spy for the Demonic Path, placed in the Alliance decades ago.\n\n\"The Demonic Lord has taken an interest in you,\" Chen Ao tells you directly, his form shimmering as he prepares to escape. \"When we finally face across the cosmic battlefield, we will settle scores. I look forward to that moment.\"\n\nBefore anyone can stop him, he erupts into dark Qi and vanishes, fleeing to his demonic masters.\n\nThe discovery of the traitor's identity sends shockwaves through the Alliance, but it also brings focus. Now knowing they were being sabotaged, they can plan more effectively. Within months, the Alliance begins a counteroffensive against the Demonic Path.\n\nYou're placed as commander of a vanguard force—twenty immortal cultivators and a thousand talented disciples. Your mission is to raid a major demonic stronghold and destroy their Qi extraction facility, which feeds power to the Demonic Lord himself.\n\nThe battle will be the most important of your life.",

Some demonic cultivators pursue power without morality, yes, but others simply believe power shouldn't be constrained by rules.\n\nAfter three days of negotiation, you broker a fragile peace: the Demonic Path agrees to cease aggressive expansion and withdraw from righteous territories. In exchange, the righteous path agrees to stop trying to eliminate them.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. Many on both sides are angered by the peace.

You're not just a commander; you're a symbol of the sect's values—loyalty, respect, and the principle that leaders should care for those under their command.\n\nWhen the Demonic Path finally falls, it's partly due to your military brilliance, but also because your leadership inspired an entire generation of disciples to fight not for personal power, but for something greater.\n\nElding Xuan eventually recovers enough to resume some of his duties. When you propose that you should move aside to let him take full leadership again, he refuses. \"No,\" he says. \"You've proven yourself worthy.

Instead, you stand firm and begin chanting the sealing incantation. Your hands move in complex patterns, channeling Qi in ways that feel like they're tearing apart your own cultivation base.\n\nThe technique activates just as the Demonic Lord's strike would have killed you. A spatial gate opens, and the Demonic Lord is pulled into a pocket dimension sealed with the combined power of a hundred fallen cultivators whose Qi was preserved for this very purpose.\n\nThe effort nearly kills you. Blood pours from your eyes, ears, and nose. Your Qi channels rupture. Your body convulses with pain. But you've succeeded—the Demonic Lord is sealed, trapped in a dimension that will hold him for at least a few decades.\n\nYou collapse, your body broken, but the war is no longer lost. With the Demonic Lord sealed away, the demonic forces lose coordination. The righteous sects rally and begin their counterattack.\n\nYou survive your injuries, though permanently weakened.
