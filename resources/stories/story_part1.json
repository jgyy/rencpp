For twenty-three years, you've lived an ordinary life in a small village at the base of the Thousand Peak Mountains. Your days were filled with mundane tasks\u2014farming, sweeping, carrying water\u2014until the night everything changed.\n\nThe skies split open with celestial light. A fierce battle between cultivators raged across the heavens above your village. Swords of pure Qi carved through clouds. Mysterious incantations shook the earth. Then, as quickly as it began, the battle ceased. One cultivator fell from the sky, crashing through your roof with tremendous force.\n\nYou rush to find a magnificent young woman in white robes, bleeding and barely breathing. Her eyes flutter open, meeting yours with an urgency you've never seen before. She grips your wrist with surprising strength despite her wounds.\n\n\"Listen carefully, mortal,\" she gasps. \"The Demonic Path searches for me. In my robes, you'll find a cultivation manual. If you can master even its basics, you might survive what's coming. Whether you use it is your choice.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, she closes her eyes. Her body becomes cold. She is gone.\n\nIn trembling hands, you find a leather-bound manual glowing with faint blue light. The words inscribe themselves in your mind as you touch it: The Stellar Ascension Method. A path to cultivation. A path to immortality.\n\nThe question is: will you take it?",

You are no longer merely mortal.\n\nAs the sun rises, exhaustion overwhelms you. You collapse into sleep, your body thrumming with newfound power. In your dreams, you see visions of infinite realms, celestial palaces, and the vast Dao waiting to be understood.\n\nWhen you wake, you realize the demonic cultivators will likely search for the woman's body.

His robes bear the insignia of the Celestial Sword Sect.\n\n\"So, you've inherited her manual,\" he says, regarding you with curious eyes. \"I am Elder Xuan of the Celestial Sword Sect.

A year in, you reach Foundation Establishment Realm\u2014a level that normally takes decades to achieve.\n\nBut isolation takes its toll. Your mind grows contemplative, sometimes haunted by loneliness. You begin to wonder if this path of solitude is truly the way to immortality, or if you're missing something crucial in cultivation.\n\nOne night, as you meditate beneath a full moon, you sense something extraordinary: a celestial phenomenon occurring in the world outside your cave. A Heavenly Tribulation is being challenged by another cultivator\u2014possibly someone at your cultivation level or beyond.\n\nYou leave your seclusion for the first time in two years and travel toward the phenomenon. What you find shocks you: an isolated cultivator, like yourself, is facing a tribulation of lightning and thunder\u2014the test that all immortals must pass.\n\nThey're struggling, on the verge of failure. You could help them, compete with them for the natural resources created by the tribulation, or observe from a distance to learn.\n\nThe choice will shape your future significantly.",

        "text": "The cosmic war spans decades, with countless battles across multiple realms. You serve as Supreme Commander of the Immortal Alliance's forces, coordinating the efforts of thousands of immortals and millions of lesser cultivators.\n\nYour strategies prove flawless. Battle after battle, the righteous forces advance. The Demonic Path is slowly pushed back, their strongholds captured or destroyed, their armies decimated.\n\nFinally, in the climactic battle, you face the Demonic Lord himself. Despite his immense power, your preparation and wisdom allow you to outmaneuver him. In a duel that shakes the heavens, you defeat him utterly.\n\nAs he falls, the entire demonic realm collapses. Evil doesn't disappear entirely\u2014it never does\u2014but it's reduced to scattered remnants that no longer pose a civilizational threat.\n\nThe cultivation world enters a golden age of peace and prosperity. Sects that fought each other for dominance come together as equals. Knowledge and culture flourish without the constant threat of demonic invasion.\n\nYou're remembered as the legendary general and strategist who saved all existence itself. Your name is spoken in reverent tones for ten thousand years.\n\nTHE END - Supreme Victory and Eternal Peace",
